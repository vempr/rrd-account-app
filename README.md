# AccStore SPA

[AccStore](https://vempr.github.io/rrd-account-app/) is a single-page application built primarily for practicing React Router and layout design, after I took Scrimba's course. Users can browse and "buy" accounts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. Purchased accounts are displayed on the host page.

<sub><sup>*There was an older repository for this project, but after not being to configure my env variables I just decided to replace the older repo.*</sup></sub>

## Stack
