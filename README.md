# AccStore App

[AccStore App](https://vempr.github.io/rrd-account-app/) is a single-page application built primarily for practicing React Router and layout design, after I took Scrimba's course.

Users can browse and "buy" accounts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. Purchased accounts are displayed on the host page.

## Stack
- **Language**: React
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript, Zod
- **Build & Deployment:** Vite, GitHub Pages
- **Data Fetching:** RTK Query
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **Design**: TailwindCSS

## APIs
- Mock accounts from **JSONPlaceholder**
- Reversed geo location using **LocationIq's API** (disabled by default because JSONPlaceholder's API returns invalid coordinates; it works though!)
